This project is beginner-level project. For the forks who had just started their journey in Web Development, must do this basic project.<br>
To keep it simple and understandable for everyone.
I have used basic Html tags to make this website.
 <ul>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Section</li>
  <li>Div</li>
  <li>Nav</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
 </ul>
 For the CSS Part, classes and id selector is used for styling and to make the website responsive Media Query is used.
